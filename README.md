# Blockchain

### A blockchain, originally block chain, is a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography. ... It is "an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way".

### A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed and public digital ledger that is used to record transactions across many computers so that the record cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks and the consensus of the network.

# Digital Ladger

### A distributed ledger (also called a shared ledger, or distributed ledger technology, DLT) is a consensus of replicated,shared, and synchronized digital data geographically spread across multiple sites, countries, or institutions. There is no central administrator or centralized data storage.
