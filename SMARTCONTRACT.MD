# SMART CONTRACT

# Nick Szabo (Computer Scientist) coined the term smart contract more then 20 years ago!

## Linux Foundation's Hyperlager blockchain has a smart contract feature called CHAINCODE!

## Chaincode is written in GO language and executed in a Docker environment.

#### Docker is lightweight container technology for executing programs.

# Smart-Contract allows for user-defined operation of arbitrary complexity. This feature enhances the capability of Ehtereum blockchain to be a powerful decentralized computing system.

#### Smart Contract has some advantages including:

##### Transfer assets other then value or crypto currency

##### Specifies rules for an operation on blockchain

##### Implements policies for transfer of assets in decentralized networks

##### Represents Business logic layer

##### Includes Messages that invoke functions

#### Bitcoin Transaction - all transactions are all about to send value.

#### Ethereum Transaction - Transaction could embed a function implemented by a smart contract

### Smart Contract provide a layer of computation logic that can be executed on the blockchain, thus availing the feature enabled by the blockchain framework

<h1>Ethereum Stack:</h1>
<h2><ul>
<li>Verticals: End User Applications</li>
<li>Application Framework: Smart Contract</li>
<li>Ethereum Blockchain and Ethereum Virtual Machine </li>
<li>Peer-to-Peer Network and Operating System</li>
<li>Hardware</li>
</ul>

#### All the operations are transparent and are recorded on the blockchain.

#### Customer can directly access the tools without an intermediary like a bank. It's like a ATM for mortgage initiation. You are holding the assets.

#### Currency transfer: 1. Service 2. Product 3.Utility

#### Smart Contract work with the application-specific semantics and constrains of the translation and verify, validates and execute them.

#### Since is deployed on the blockchain, the smart-contract leverages the immutable recording and trust model of the blockchain. Since the smart contract is deployed on the blockchain, it is a immutable piece of code and once deployed, it cant be changed.

#### Smart Contract can store variables in it called state variables. We could retrieve how these variables change over the blocks
