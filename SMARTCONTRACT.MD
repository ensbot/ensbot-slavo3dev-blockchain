# SMART CONTRACT

# Nick Szabo (Computer Scientist) coined the term smart contract more then 20 years ago!

## Linux Foundation's Hyperlager blockchain has a smart contract feature called CHAINCODE!

## Chaincode is written in GO language and executed in a Docker environment.

#### Docker is lightweight container technology for executing programs.

# Smart-Contract allows for user-defined operation of arbitrary complexity. This feature enhances the capability of Ehtereum blockchain to be a powerful decentralized computing system.

#### Smart Contract has some advantages including:

##### Transfer assets other then value or crypto currency

##### Specifies rules for an operation on blockchain

##### Implements policies for transfer of assets in decentralized networks

##### Represents Business logic layer

##### Includes Messages that invoke functions

#### Bitcoin Transaction - all transactions are all about to send value.

#### Ethereum Transaction - Transaction could embed a function implemented by a smart contract

### Smart Contract provide a layer of computation logic that can be executed on the blockchain, thus availing the feature enabled by the blockchain framework

<h1>Ethereum Stack:</h1>
<h2><ul>
<li>Verticals: End User Applications</li>
<li>Application Framework: Smart Contract</li>
<li>Ethereum Blockchain and Ethereum Virtual Machine </li>
<li>Peer-to-Peer Network and Operating System</li>
<li>Hardware</li>
</ul>
</h2>

#### All the operations are transparent and are recorded on the blockchain.

#### Customer can directly access the tools without an intermediary like a bank. It's like a ATM for mortgage initiation. You are holding the assets.

#### Currency transfer: 1. Service 2. Product 3.Utility

#### Smart Contract work with the application-specific semantics and constrains of the translation and verify, validates and execute them.

#### Since is deployed on the blockchain, the smart-contract leverages the immutable recording and trust model of the blockchain. Since the smart contract is deployed on the blockchain, it is a immutable piece of code and once deployed, it cant be changed.

#### Smart Contract can store variables in it called state variables. We could retrieve how these variables change over the blocks

#### Contract in Ethereum Blockchain

<ul>
<li>Pragma Directive</li>
<li>Name of the smart contract<li>
<li>Data or the state variables, that state of the contract</li>
<li>Collection of functions to carry out the intent of a smart contract</li>
</ul>

#### According to metropolis version, once a smart contract is deployed its become immutable

#### Smart Contract can be create on behalf of an externally owned account, by application programmatically from the command-line interface and by a script of commands from high level applications and user interface of UI

#### It can also be created from inside a smart contract

#### We need an address for a smart contract to deploy it and invoke it's a function.

#### The address is computed by hashing the account number of externally owned account UI and nonce

<h1>Smart Contract / Remix Compile Process</h1>
<h2>
<ul>
<li>ABI - Application Binary Interface - the interface schema for transaction to invoke functions on the smart contract instance bytecode</li>
<li>Contract Bytecode - is the bytecode that is executed for instantiating a smart contract on EVM </li>
<li>Web Deployed Script -
<ul>
<li>JSON script to web application to invoke smart contract function</li>
<li>Script for programmatically deploying a smart contract from web application</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Gas Estimates - Provides a Gas Estimates for deploying a smart contract and for the function invocation</li>
<li>Function Hashes - First Four byte of the function signatures to facilitate function invocation by a transaction</li>
<li>Instance ByteCode - The ByteCode of the smart contract instance</li>
</ul>
</h2>

#### Remix Solidity compiler generate several artifacts! Important once: name of the contract, ByteCode, ABI...

### ABI is also generated for high level language application.

###### Example: Web apps to interact with the binary smart contract!!

### A unique target account is reserved for a smart contract creation and deployment.

### Target account 0(zero) If a target's address is zero or null it is meant for creating a new smart contract using payload feed.
